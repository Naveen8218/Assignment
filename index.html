            <h5 class="text-danger card-header text-center"><u>Overview of The Problem:</u></h5>
            <p class="card-text">The fact that our designer goods do not represent wealth for positive utility is having
                more
                negativedamage to society than we can fathom. This article is going to help detail why, and detail our
                solution
                in progress. </p>

            <p class="card-text">As individuals, once we cover our basic needs, status becomes an intrinsic motivator in
                the rest of our
                actions. Status comes in many forms. The healthiest / most enlightened cultures put the highest status
                in rewarding positive sum behavior. In global culture, luxury goods like a Gucci bag/belt have become
                widespread as top status symbols, reflecting vapid use of money as the highest form of status. It has
                become such common Christmas list item for broke young teenagers that the richest man on the planet at
                the time of this writing got his riches from selling these overpriced goods representing nothing more
                than the ability to waste money. Collectively this misrepresentation of true status (service to others)
                is attributing more damage to building a healthy positive culture than we can imagine.</p>


            <p class="card-text">Social media, our emergent global cultural production system, could be used
                collectively to unify
                humanity around bettering ourselves and others. Instead it is used to further extract youth through a
                false form of status as a service. Imagine a world where this wasteful spending was considered
                cancelable. One where we collectively take accountability for the capability to money to the positive
                growth of us as a species. Imagine a world where the designer things we wore showed off spending a lot
                of money to make a lot of positive impact. If the world you imagined only went as far as to redistribute
                the wealth of designer wear, try imagining the deeper cultural effects this new alignment would have.
            </p>

            <p class="font-weight-bold font-italic card-text">“Over the past hundred years we have increase the global
                GDP
                sevenfold, yet wealth inequality continues to skyrocket and luxury spending grows rapidly. In order to
                change the failure of redistribution of wealth at scale, we must effectively influence culture and help
                redefine what “status” is in the modern age. This will ultimately change the flow of money in society as
                the new age of status being helping the world, becomes more prominent. We have failed at building a
                society which healthily distributes wealth/power. Given society is a collective project we are
                responsible for, we think this stems from the culture not supporting doing good as the highest form of
                status. We have more than enough resources, but many people without access to them, and a culture that
                motivates and glorifies overspending on vanity luxury goods.” - Jack Jay</p>

        <div class="card shadow">
            <h5 class="text-primary text-center card-header"><u>A Deeper Dive:</u></h5>
            <p class="card-text">On a fundamental level once someone gets the basics covered as in food, water, shelter.
                They can start to
                spend their time and money on convenience, health, and purpose but more often than not; status is where
                a majority of surplus wealth goes.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Societally we lack an alignment of our status symbols with creating a better world and
                with bettering
                ourselves. This idea to change what we cultural see as status has been referred to as “Status
                Engineering”.</p>

            <p class="card-text">What we wear is the most direct way we have to represent ourselves and our
                ideals/values. What your role
                model wears, or any person of influence is shaping the idea of status in that child, teenager, or adults
                mind. </p>

            <p class="h6">Status is what we are buying when we pay $1, $10, or even $500 extra for a certain brand of
                T-Shirt irrespective of comfort.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The problem is not that buying status is a failure mode of an individual. Status is a
                form of positive
                competitive drive in society and a tool for respect attribution. That’s why you see Dior shoes in
                economy. This is not a miscalculation, currently the status from spending $1100 on shoes does have more
                long term value than things like first class because we are playing the game of unenlightened
                capitalism.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The problem is that we support the status symbol which costs $1100 and does no good for
                humanity. Thus
                this expenditure is not a failure of the buyer who bought status, it is only misguided that we do not
                have designer shoes that cost $1100, which builds a literal house in Bangladesh (a small home can be
                built as a permanent structure for someone for this amount). We need higher forms of status to exist in
                order to progress our culture which will aid in the distribution of wealth and power on a systemic
                level. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Once higher status objects are unveiled will these purely financial status seems become
                recognized for
                their tackiness and buying status will coincide with doing good. With no better alternative currently,
                we idolize symbols of wealth. Thus, on our highest display of who we are, the clothing we wear, we
                display 0 creativity or care for the world in spending and instead promote wasting wealth for the sake
                of power/leverage over others, and then we wonder why society is misaligned to building a healthy world.
                Fashion, what we wear, is the biggest signal we have in representing our identity and values.</p>

            <p class="card-text">If we can provide a better representation of status in clothing we can not only change
                the money used to
                buy status into doing good for the world, but we can change our core representation of status in society
                towards doing good.</p>

            <p class="card-text">While the larger belief is that this systemic change is the real impact in realigning
                our culture towards
                true status, the amount of funds in status spending that could be redirected towards positive causes is
                also no joke. </p>

            <p class="font-italic card-text">The personal luxury goods market is projected to grow from USD 257.26
                billion in 2020
                to USD 352.84 billion in 2027</p>

            <p class="font-italic font-weight-bold card-text">The Luxury Cars Market size is expected to grow from USD
                449.7
                Billion in 2019 to USD 655.0 Billion by 2027; It is estimated to grow at a CAGR of 9.3% from 2020 to
                2027. </p>

            <p class="card-text">Aligning status culturally on a global scale means reattributing that wealth towards
                benefit for humanity
                and shifting the entire global view of wealth. </p>

        <div class="card shadow">
            <h5 class="text-primary card-header text-center"><u>The Simple Solution</u></h5>

            <p class="font-weight-bold card-text">Thought experiments make it obvious that this idea is memetic, and
                just has not
                been tried in the market. Once one initial company opens up this model, many more will follow and copy:
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">For the same price as a Louie Vuitton bag, a permanent shelter can be built in
                Bangladesh for a family in
                need. This gives rise to the idea that anytime someone walks into a designer store and purchased an
                item, they are having to burn down a house (most making this decision unknowingly). </p>

            <p class="card-text">Based on the principle “if a penny saved is a penny earned” we can extrapolate that to
                a Louie bag is a
                home burned. But just telling someone not to flex is not going to solve the problem. If we really want
                to win this war, we just need to sell higher status, for the same price. </p>

            <div class="card">
                <img src="image/https___s3-us-west-2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="image">
            </div>

            <P class="card-text">Imagine trying to connect with a luxury purse buyer as protestors outside of a designer
                store. Rather
                than simply protesting their spending on that good, we need to sell them a better version of what they
                are buying. </P>

            <P class="card-text">Protests outside of stores that sell meat where stands are set up showing customers
                videos of the harmed
                animals may not be a great way to connect with the target audience, and often cause a greater divide in
                mindsets. </P>

            <P class="card-text">In this case volunteers or employees could stand outside of luxury goods markets,
                sporting the aligned
                luxury merch. Rodeo drive for example is a notorious spot where every designer store not only has a
                shop, but theres a steady flow of customers. </P>

            <p class="card-text">Social media accounts devoted to making content here are already massively viral
                amassing hundreds of
                millions of views interviewing buyers. Each successful conversion, would make for a viral video and an
                ad set, bringing potentially thousands of new customers while kickstarting educating the world of the
                low status of wasteful spending now that a better alternative exists. </p>

            <h6>Making Altruism Culturally High Status.</h6>

            <p class="card-text">Ultimately, the more projects that promote this new line of thinking, the more people
                think others think
                this way, the more status will align culturally with its true nature. Watching others do good for the
                world has always given us more hope for humanity. We believe the flippening of status has the potential
                to solve the worlds greatest cause of poverty, the failed distribution of wealth worldwide.
            </p>

            <p class="card-text">We don’t need to enforce rules where people are forced to give up their things, we need
                brands that
                invest in education for the masses to wake up to what real status/value is and place higher alternatives
                into the market. </p>

            <p class="card-text">With the release of more and more globally disruptive technology, anxiousness about our
                focus on making
                sure things goes right becomes more apparent. By educating the world on alignment of using money and
                power for good from the most basic layer of apparel we will begin to cause this shift. With the right
                priming, a large amount of legacy wealth will be funneled into shifting the global workforce into
                focusing on the worlds greatest problems. </p>

            <p class="card-text">There’s a vibe shift underway, as we get closer and closer to a post scarcity economy,
                the eternal
                currency of the future of good karma will become more clear.</p>

            <p class="card-text">For the greedy who still wish to hold on to ownership of something land is going to
                skyrocket as an
                asset, ownership on plots of earth will be seen as one of the steadiest investments as we approach a
                hyper decrease in the cost of building. </p>

            <p class="card-text">The people who recognize this shift will do well to mortgage their house, buying a
                larger plot of land
                somewhere. </p>

            <p class="card-text">If super-intelligence is democratic, honoring that ownership of land will be a decision
                the world makes.
                (Clearly the idea that those who hoarded their wealth and tried to hold on to value should have more
                value than those who put their wealth to work, giving up their assets, is one that will be a hard
                attempt) Propaganda for people to relinquish their assets to funds more of the poverty of the world will
                help the world make this decision when the time comes. </p>

            <p class="card-text">While theres no specific data for what defines “Luxury” housing, this is of course a
                far larger asset
                class which outshines the luxury car and luxury goods market.</p>

            <p class="card-text">What actually makes one house better than the other (often its simply the status it has
                rather than
                utility) if it was all about utility people would buy the cheaper house and install the heated seat
                toilets, and floors etc. (but then how would people respect them more?). What if we were not ranked by
                the size of our house, but instead by the size of our donations.</p>

            <p class="card-text">You may remember that app that was $999 called “Im rich” and did nothing. That’s what
                designer clothing
                represents today. Useless expense for materials with patterns that represent pure vanity. Pure spending
                power gone to pure status.</p>

            <p class="card-text">It is tasteless…. and we believe society is not only waking up to that fact, but it is
                inevitable that we
                will create better alternatives.</p>

            <p class="card-text">In a subjective culture sense we see IN-YOUR-FACE luxury style goods declining while a
                push for
                understated looks are coming forward. Brands such as Gucci are being seen as more oversaturated, and
                pieces that lack design besides the plastery of the luxury logo on the piece are seen as tacky.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Evidence of this: <br>
                Brands like Gucci are becoming less hip. <br>
                Designer brands that are in your face are not it. <br>
                Designer that’s low-key is now the trend. <br>
                Designer is dialing back as consumers replace spending to these models.</p>

            <p class="card-text">We believe the changing of status starting at a clothing level will cause one of the
                largest wealth flow
                transfers towards good for the world. Imagine an individual who is struggling to provide for themselves,
                eventually however, they begin to thrive. They start a business and after having major success exit for
                a few million dollars. What is the standard look and lifestyle of this person after this event?</p>

            <p class="card-text"> For the most part, most people are living to keep their “social survival mammoth”
                feeling good. This is
                the part of the brain which feeds off of status, which defines our place in the social hierarchy. And
                this is not something I believe we can change, people WILL naturally compete to go up the chain of the
                social hierarchy, people want to outdo each other, people are competitive, people are different and
                respect should be given where it is due.</p>

            <p class="card-text">This climb, this fight up the ladder is not inherently bad, what's wrong right now is
                what we consider to
                be markers of people who are higher up that ladder. We have been sold a narrative by the luxury and
                designer corporations, who have massive budgets to win the celebrities over, that designer and luxury
                clothing IS high status. Those who spend $4k on a designer bag versus one of equivalent quality for $50
                are put higher on the status scale. If we can collectively redefine this status symbol as tacky, which
                has already been changing for in-your-face luxury design brand styles, we will change where the money
                which pays for status goes. </p>

            <p class="card-text">While projects like Shelter NFT would build a home for a family who would have
                otherwise never had one
                before for the same price as a designer bag, it is no replacement for a BAG. People still want to buy a
                high end item, so instead, a brand which offers that price of bag, that level of quality, whose surplus
                funds goes towards making that positive change is perfect.</p>

            <h6 class="font-italic class=" card-text"">“If only we could make love what people optimize for over wealth.
                We can help
                society at large realize that is the true way to win the game of life” -Jack Jay</h6>
            <p class="card-text">It wasn't until our culture defined cigarettes as bad that we quit them. They are just
                as addicting. They
                become negative status symbols. Hopefully showing the power status has on human behavior. If you thought
                sex/mating runs the world just wait till you realize that status is above even that</p>
